# Pubmed-txt-to-pdf-retrieval-via-Entrez
This is a bash script to retrieve the summary of papers from Pubmed using NCBI's Entrez tool and to convert the raw .txt files into .pdf files

To customize, simply input the desired folder destination into output_dir=""  and modify -query "" with your own desired search terms

NB: Still not a perfect conversion since the .pdfs formatting is kind of messed up, but the results.txt output still contains the original .txts in proper format
