# Pubmed-txt-to-pdf-retrieval-via-Entrez
This is a bash script to retrieve a summary of the first 200 papers on a desired search topic from Pubmed using NCBI's Entrez tool and to convert these raw .txt files into .pdf files

To customize, simply input the desired folder destination into output_dir=""  and modify -query "" with your own desired search terms

NB: Still not a perfect conversion since the .pdfs formatting is kind of messed up, but the results.txt output still contains the original .txts in proper format
